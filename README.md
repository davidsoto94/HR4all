## What is HR4ALL?

This is a personal project to make easy HR related data for small and medium companies and HR outsourcings.

## What technologies I plan using?

I'm thinking on user normal NextJS with TRPC (to learn), and planteScale or a normal SQL DB for data, as well as S3 (and internal storage in the server) for the files

This is kind of a glorified DB for HR management, nothing fancy but really useful for small companies that normally handle this things in Excel, phisical and virtual folders in one computer or google drive.
